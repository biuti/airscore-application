#
# Flight validation parameters.

# Minimum number of fixes in a file.
min_fixes: 50

# Maximum time between fixes, seconds.
# Soft limit, some fixes are allowed to exceed.
max_seconds_between_fixes: 50

# Minimum time between fixes, seconds.
# Soft limit, some fixes are allowed to exceed.
min_seconds_between_fixes: 1

# Maximum number of fixes exceeding time between fix constraints.
max_time_violations: 10

# Maximum number of times a file can cross the 0:00 UTC time.
max_new_days_in_flight: 2

# Minimum average of absolute values of altitude changes in a file.
# This is needed to discover altitude sensors (either pressure or
# gps) that report either always constant altitude, or almost
# always constant altitude, and therefore are invalid. The unit
# is meters/fix.
min_avg_abs_alt_change: 0.01

# Maximum altitude change per second between fixes, meters per second.
# Soft limit, some fixes are allowed to exceed.
max_alt_change_rate: 50

# Maximum number of fixes that exceed the altitude change limit.
max_alt_change_violations: 3

# Absolute maximum altitude, meters.
max_alt: 6000

# Absolute minimum altitude, meters.
min_alt: -600

#
# Flight detection parameters.
#

# Minimum ground speed to switch to flight mode, km/h.
min_gsp_flight: 15

# Minimum idle time (i.e. time with speed below min_gsp_flight) to switch
# to landing, seconds. Exception: end of the file (tail fixes that
# do not trigger the above condition), no limit is applied there.
min_landing_time: 300

# In case there are multiple continuous segments with ground
# speed exceeding the limit, which one should be taken?
# Available options:
#   - "first": take the first segment, ignore the part after
#     the first detected landing.
#   - "concat": concatenate all segments; will include the down
#     periods between segments (legacy behavior)
which_flight_to_pick: first

#
# Thermal detection parameters.
#

# Minimum bearing change to enter a thermal, deg/sec.
min_bearing_change_circling: 6

# Minimum time between fixes to calculate bearing change, seconds.
# See the usage for a more detailed comment on why this is useful.
min_time_for_bearing_change: 5

# Minimum time to consider circling a thermal, seconds.
min_time_for_thermal: 60
